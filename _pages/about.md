# Welcome

Welcome to my website! I am Joshua Calzadillas, a MS student in (Robotics) Control Systems Engineer for the Electical & Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the University of New Hampshire. My current research is focused on control systems for cutting-edge additive manufacturing processes that are being used for a wide range of applications. My research interests are Robotics, Conrol Systems, AI/ML, IoT Sensor Technologies, Edge Computing, Federated ML, Cybersecurity, and other relatable disciplines that peak my interest. I have both working and academic experience with multiple publications and improvements to both academia and the industry alike. I find myself enjoying the progress of learning and solving problems that have either been unexplored and or difficult to solve.
