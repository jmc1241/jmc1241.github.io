My name is Joshua Calzadillas! I am a Graduate student studying (Robotics) Control Systems Engineer for the Electical & Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). My current research is focused on control systems for cutting-edge additive manufacturing processes that are being used for a wide range of applications. My research interests are Robotics, Conrol Systems, AI/ML, IoT Sensor Technologies, Edge Computing, Federated ML, Cybersecurity, and other relatable disciplines that peak my interest. I have both working and academic experience with multiple publications during my undergraduate years in **[IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/)** & **[ACM](https://www.acm.org/)**. My involvement at **[UNH](https://unh.edu/)** has provided me many opportunities to work as both a Research Assistant (RA) and as a leader in clubs and organizations. With many years of experience learning and improving my skillsets, I have learned how to applymyself in a vast area of Industry & Academia alike. In my JR. year I worked as a DevOps intern at **[Alert Innovation](https://www.walmartasr.com/)** and I have learned a great deal from my other involvements as well. I mostly setup the monitoring solution for the company to ensure that their on-prem and inn the cloud systems were transitioned. However, I was also working on other projects that involved learning about development pipelines and improving them for industry purposes. Looking back at my involvements, I generally find myself enjoying the progress of learning and solving problems that have either been unexplored and or difficult to solve. I enjoy finding ways to improve or invent on projects that I find useful for myself and others. Thank you for your time!

Current Projects
======
**Temperature Control of a Specific Additive Manufacturing Process**
Currently, some of the publications associated with this type of control system have been presented for another application. However, we aim to try and incorporate some of those concepts in with some experimental analysis on the working control parameters available for our application to provide a more real-time and consistent way of controlling a specialized additive manufacturing process that has been quiet for years. Minimal publications resulting this sort of system with a control system allows for more diversity into the field of additive manufacturing providing a better yeild on expanding the horizon of our current fronteir.
