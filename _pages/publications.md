The list of publications starting from my most recent degree going down into my Undergraduate degree describes in a simple manner what work was done and how I supported the project/publication with my efforts. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me with the information posted on the left hand side.

Graduate Research Publications
======
I will be publishing soon on related research material on additive manufacturing and control systems.

Undergraduate Research Publications
======
**Statistical Analysis for Applications of Federated Machine Learning using House Plants**- John Lacourse (Ph.D) & Shaad Mahmud (Ph.D) - UNH -  May 2024 - [Link Here](https://media-gallery.unh.edu/media_submission/1527/?added__year=2024&conference=2&event=4&department=43)
- Designed a federated learning (FL) framework to support federated learning based on cross-silo, cross-device, and other architectures
- Designed a FL infrastructure architecture to support IoT sensor nodes asynchronously
- Designed a sensor node system that operates 10+ sensors in real time while operating an AI model that predicts plant health
- Designed a set of AI models that use deep learning and GAN to model plant health
- Utilized machine learning models to classify and cluster different states of a houseplant
- Implemented a Fed-Avg algorithm to aggregate the Federated-Learning environment
- Integrated Redis, TensorFlow, PyTorch, REST, & Azure to the project
