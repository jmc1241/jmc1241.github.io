## Statistical Analysis for Applications of Federated Machine Learning using House Plants - John Lacourse (Ph.D) & Shaad Mahmud (Ph.D) - UNH -  May 2024 - [Link Here](https://media-gallery.unh.edu/media_submission/1527/?added__year=2024&conference=2&event=4&department=43)

**Summary**

This research project allowed me to find a method of identifying specific traits that are associated with a plant and attempt to identify the state it was in based on 3 simple metrics. This process allowed for state identification to occur using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that were aggregated into a Federated Machine Learning (Fed-ML) system for a globalized version of state identification using other devices to obtain their parameterization values for identifying the plant's state. The plant that was used in this project was a set of 5 Bamboo plants from Lowes. 

**Highlights**
- Designed a federated machine learning (Fed-ML) framework to support federated learning based on cross-silo, cross-device, and other architectures
- Designed a Fed-ML infrastructure architecture to support IoT sensor nodes asynchronously
- Designed a sensor node system that operates 10+ sensors in real time while operating an AI model that predicts plant health
- Designed a set of AI models that use deep learning and GAN to model plant health
- Utilized machine learning models to classify and cluster different states of a houseplant
- Implemented a Fed-Avg algorithm to aggregate the Federated-Learning environment
- Integrated Redis, TensorFlow, PyTorch, REST, & Azure to the project

 ## Hardware Security Risks and Threat Analyses in Advanced Manufacturing Industry - Qiaoyan Yu (Ph.D) - UNH - September 2023 - [Link Here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3603502)

 **Summary**

This paper outines the general direction that was approached with our research that we had published and addressing the future concerns that we are looking into to demonstrate why these points must be further investigated by ourselves and our community. The overall research direction that we focused on were hardware trojans (HT) and how they affect the Advanced Manufacturing Industry (AMI) through methods of hardware exploitation. However, there were a few tangents that were related to the HT aspects that focsued specifically on communications and how that can affect the AMI through methods of alternative exploitation and sniffing techniques.

**Highlights**
- Contributed to this paper by describing some of the associated problems with AMI & cybersecurity
- Further discussed some of my previous works with Mezan and how we are looking to further our research goals
- Assisted with the writing and approaches associated with this work


## WIP: Interdisciplinary Teaching via Hands-on Practice in Cybersecurity - Qiaoyan Yu (Ph.D) - UNH - March 2023 - [Link Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10402266)

**Summary**

This paper is to demonstrate UNH's capabilities associated with providing a more involved cybersecurity route that is affected by both hardware and architecture security. The NHCyberSee Lab was an effort primarily designed by Professor Qiaoyan Yu with the efforts of other professors such as Professor Dean Sullivan, Professor Diliang Chen, Professor Karen Jin, and Professor Dongpen Xu. Our goal is to support the University and our research by providing more of an understanding to the Undergraduate students on the advanced topics of hardware and architecture security. My involvement with this project focused on developing the student education tracks through clubs, organizations, and other alternative methods such as hardware hacking competitions such as MITRE e-CTF.


**Highlights**
- Designed a website to support the NHCyberSEE lab
- Provided insight to students through organization and acitivites such as MITRE-eCTF
- Provided leadership towards these goals for the university to further our involvement with MITRE-eCTF
- Helped incorporate infrastructure advice for a fully supported large scale infrastructure of VMs, applications, and other cybersecurity & hardware security focused projects


## Hardware Security in Advanced Manufacturing**- Qiaoyan Yu (Ph.D) - UNH - June 2022 - [Link Here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3526241.3530829)

**Summary**

This paper describes the Hardware Security (HS) risks associated with the Advanced Manufacturing Industry (AMI). The goal of this paper is to further our understanding of the processes that can occur when a device is at risk to multiple attack vectors. Our understanding of the technologies associated with this industry is the ability for these devices to be deployed and updated in long term sequences. This means that they are significantly at risk for a cybersecurity threat to disrupt their process and cost the company money that may be too much for most companies to handle. This work highlights the problems that we are looking to investigate.

**Highlights**
- Contributed to this paper by describing some of the associated problems with AMI & cybersecurity
- Further discussed some of my previous works with Mezan and how we are looking to further our research goals
- Assisted with the writing and approaches associated with this work


## Challenges of Securing Low-Power LoRaWAN Devices Deployed in Advanced Manufacturing - Qiaoyan Yu (Ph.D) - UNH - April 2022 - [Link Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806290)

**Summary**

This paper is a demonstration of communciation based attacks for hackers to disrupt the Advanced Manufacturing Industry's (AMI) process through the attack vector of a communication system. The specific application for this paper is to further demonstrate the capabilities and associated problems that a communication protocol such as LoRaWAN has towards the AMI. 

**Highlights**
- Developed different exploitation methods using both software and hardware based attacks
- Devloped a LoRaWAN jamming system with an Arduino based microcontroller
- Investigated the result of various jamming attacks using both software and hardware analysis
- Described different exploitation methods using both software and hardware based attacks
- Analyzed the communication packets and limitations using GNU Radio
