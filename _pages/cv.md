Summary
======
My name is Joshua Calzadillas! I am a Graduate student studying (Robotics) Control Systems Engineer for the Electical & Computer Engineering (ECE). My current research is focused on control systems for cutting-edge additive manufacturing processes that are being used for a wide range of applications. My research interests are Robotics, Conrol Systems, AI/ML, IoT Sensor Technologies, Edge Computing, Federated ML, Cybersecurity, and other relatable disciplines that peak my interest. I have both working and academic experience with multiple publications during my undergraduate years in [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) & [ACM](https://www.acm.org/). My involvement at [UNH](https://unh.edu/) has provided me many opportunities to work as both a Research Assistant (RA) and as a leader in clubs and organizations. With many years of experience learning and improving my skillsets, I have learned how to applymyself in a vast area of Industry & Academia alike. In my JR. year I worked as a DevOps intern at**[Alert Innovation](https://www.walmartasr.com/)**and I have learned a great deal from my other involvements as well. I mostly setup the monitoring solution for the company to ensure that their on-prem and inn the cloud systems were transitioned. However, I was also working on other projects that involved learning about development pipelines and improving them for industry purposes. Looking back at my involvements, I generally find myself enjoying the progress of learning and solving problems that have either been unexplored and or difficult to solve. I enjoy finding ways to improve or invent on projects that I find useful for myself and others. Thank you for your time!
