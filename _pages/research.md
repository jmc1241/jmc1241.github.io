My current research is on additive manufacturing control systems with advance manufacturing techniques and applications. This means that controlling robotics and other machines such as CNC & milling machines are also within my domain to produce a product associated with additive manufacturing. My specilized domain is going to be within the control systems of robotics and some more cost effective machines such as the Bridgeport. Our goal is to fundamentally provide a control system that can operate for specilized applications and apply them for projects that are going to be associated with my domain and the Olson Center at UNH.
