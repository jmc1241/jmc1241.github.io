My research is focused on control systems associated Friction Stir Additive Manufacturing (FSAM) which is an Additive Manfuacturing (AM) process in the Advanced Manufacturing (AdM) field.
The materials associated with FSAM are mostly metals (as of the current author's knowledge) which is why FSAM is considered a Metal Additive Manufacutring (MAM) process.
FSAM has been also called AFSD in some literature, while they are considered different processes, they are sometimes generalized into an umbrella term.
FSAM has been around since 2002, however, there are only a few publications associated with FSAM control systems (as shown in figure #). 
For this reason, I am interested in progressing the process of FSAM to allow for more investigation into it's capabilities and understanding the dynamics associated with this process.
My ressearch is in conjunction with the Olson Center at UNH and we are working together to come up with a way of controling this difficult and unkown process.
